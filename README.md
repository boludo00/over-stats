# Our Journey
In the beginning, we had no idea what we wanted to do.
After brainstorming for an hour, we decided that video games, our favorite pastime, would be the subject of our project.
Instantly we got to work on an overwatch data visualizer using overwatch-js.
The backend was done in less than an hour, and our website was already looking pretty good.
But as the saying goes, the last 20% takes just as long as the first 80%.
We spent over 6 hours combined fixing bugs and handling extrenious cases, most of which was not particularly "fun".
Despite the drawbacks, we finally pulled through and finished the project by 3:00 AM, 16 and a half hours after we started.
We all had a great experience and loved the whole journey. Here are some pictures from our development process:
